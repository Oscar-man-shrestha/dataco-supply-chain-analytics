# DataCo Supply Chain Analytics

Foundations of Data Science (23CSE351) · Group 4

Shared repository for the DataCo Smart Supply Chain project. We study what drives late deliveries and loss-making orders, test those drivers statistically, fit OLS and classification models taught in the course, and present results in Power BI.

## Project questions

1. Which factors are associated with late delivery and with loss-making orders (chi-squared, ANOVA, t-tests)?
2. How well can profit be explained with OLS regression (coefficients, uncertainty, assumption checks)?
3. How well can we classify loss vs profit orders, and late vs on-time deliveries, once leaking columns are removed?

## Shared definitions

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Late-delivery target | `Late_delivery_risk` / `late` (0/1) |
| Loss target | `loss = 1` if `Benefit per order` < 0, else 0 (zero profit = not loss) |
| Profit target (OLS) | `Benefit per order` (continuous) |
| Split and seed | 80/20 stratified for classifiers, `random_state = 42` |
| Cleaned file | `A_preprocessing_eda/outputs/cleaned_supply_chain.csv` — produced by Oscar; nobody else edits it |

### Rules every teammate must follow

- Do not edit the cleaned CSV. Request changes through Oscar.
- Do not use leakage columns: `Delivery Status`, `Days for shipping (real)`, `shipping date (DateOrders)`, `Order Profit Per Order`, `Order Item Profit Ratio`.
- `Benefit per order` is the OLS target only — never a feature for loss or OLS.
- `Benefit_signed_log` is a transform of `Benefit per order` (correlation ≈ 0.94 with `loss`): use it only as a response, never as a feature.
- `late`, `loss`, and `Late_delivery_risk` are targets, not features.
- Scale numeric features after the split, fitting on the training fold only.
- Drop one dummy level per one-hot group before a model with an intercept.
- Keep `Order Status` out of models until the group decides. It is post-order information, and CANCELED and SUSPECTED_FRAUD orders are 100% not-late, so it leaks the late target.
- `Days for shipment (scheduled)` is one-to-one with `Shipping Mode` (0 = Same Day, 1 = First, 2 = Second, 4 = Standard): use one, not both.
- `Sales`, `Order Item Total` and `Order Item Discount` are algebraically tied to price, quantity and discount rate (Sales vs Order Item Total r ≈ 0.99): do not put them in the same linear model.

### Re-run Phase 1 locally

```bash
python -m pip install -r A_preprocessing_eda/requirements.txt
python A_preprocessing_eda/phase1_cleaning.py
python A_preprocessing_eda/phase1_validate.py
```

Or open and run `A_preprocessing_eda/phase1_cleaning.ipynb` (from the repo root or that folder).

Raw path default: `dataset/DataCoSupplyChainDataset.csv` (`encoding="latin-1"`).

## Phase 2b (Mithun) — hypothesis tests

```bash
python -m pip install -r B_hypothesis_powerbi/requirements.txt
python B_hypothesis_powerbi/phase2b_tests.py
```

Results: [`B_hypothesis_powerbi/outputs/PHASE2B_REPORT.md`](B_hypothesis_powerbi/outputs/PHASE2B_REPORT.md) · [`tests_results.csv`](B_hypothesis_powerbi/outputs/tests_results.csv) · [`handoff_phase2b.md`](B_hypothesis_powerbi/outputs/handoff_phase2b.md)

## Phase 3a (Hisana) — OLS and loss classification

```bash
python -m pip install -r C_loss_ols/requirements.txt
python C_loss_ols/c_ols_loss.py
python C_loss_ols/c_signal_check.py
```

**Main finding:** order-time variables do not explain or forecast loss-making orders. This is a result about the data, not a modelling failure.

| Result (test set, 36,104 orders) | Value |
| --- | --- |
| OLS on `Benefit per order`, R² (train / test) | 0.0165 / 0.0200 |
| OLS test RMSE vs mean-only baseline | $102.79 vs $103.84 |
| OLS assumptions | Fail on the raw scale (residual skew -5.63, Breusch-Pagan and Jarque-Bera p ≈ 0); HC3 robust SEs and a signed-log refit reported |
| "Always predict profit" accuracy | 0.8128 (recall 0 — accuracy alone is misleading) |
| Loss models (balanced, oversampling, SMOTE) | precision ≈ 0.19 (the base rate), recall ≈ 0.49–0.52, ROC-AUC ≈ 0.50 |
| Gradient-boosting probe, all order-time columns incl. product | loss AUC 0.505, profit R² 0.011 |
| Same product, price, quantity 1, discount ≤ 5% (1,342 lines) | 18.9% still end in loss |

Interpretation (not tested, because the dataset has no cost columns): the missing information is likely backend operational cost (product, fulfilment, returns), so loss cannot be forecast from the order record alone. Do not describe any variable as a "driver" of loss, and do not quote the F1 of 0.315 (it comes from flagging every order as a loss).

## Note on large files

`dataset/DataCoSupplyChainDataset.csv` (~91 MB) and `cleaned_supply_chain.csv` (~94 MB) are under GitHub’s 100 MB hard limit. GitHub may warn above 50 MB. If clone/push becomes awkward, switch those two files to Git LFS.

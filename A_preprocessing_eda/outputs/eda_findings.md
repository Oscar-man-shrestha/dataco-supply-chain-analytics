Discount column used below is `Order Item Discount Rate` (rate) and `Order Item Discount` (amount). Shipping days means `Days for shipment (scheduled)`.

Mean scheduled days: 2.9318. Mean discount rate: 0.1017.

## Findings (plain language)

### F1. Shipping mode dominates late delivery.

`First Class` has the highest late rate (95.32%), while `Standard Class` is lowest (38.07%). This is the clearest categorical signal for the late-delivery question.

Plot: `bar_late_rate_by_Shipping_Mode.png`
### F2. Late rate also differs by market and region.

Markets range from `LATAM` (54.36%) to `Europe` (55.21%). Among regions, `Central Africa` is highest (57.96%) and `Canada` is lowest (48.80%).

### F3. Loss rate is fairly similar across customer segments.

Loss shares: Home Office 18.85%, Corporate 18.82%, Consumer 18.60%. Segment may still be worth testing, but the effect looks smaller than shipping mode for lateness.

### F4. Profit is heavy-tailed and often negative.

`Benefit per order` mean 21.9750, median 31.5200, skewness -4.7418. Box/violin plots by market and shipping mode show wide spreads; OLS should expect assumption issues.

### F5. Discount rate vs loss looks weak on averages; watch the scatter with profit.

The discount-vs-profit scatter still shows many deep losses at higher discount rates, but the mean discount rate gap is small: loss 0.1022 vs non-loss 0.1015. B should report effect size for T6, not only the p-value.

### F6. Scheduled shipping days differ for late vs on-time orders.

Mean scheduled days: late 2.4711, on-time 3.4911. This is a candidate feature for D (known at order time, not leakage).

Plot: `overlay_scheduled_days_late.png`
### F7. Sales are right-skewed; the log transform helps for visuals.

`Sales` skewness 2.8842. Use `Sales_log` for distribution plots; keep raw `Sales` for modelling unless C chooses otherwise.

Plot: `hist_compare_Sales.png`
### F8. Order volume and late rate move over the calendar.

Busiest month in this extract: 2016-10 (5,398 orders). Highest monthly late rate: 2016-06 (56.85%). B can use month as a slicer in Power BI; D may try `order_month` / `order_year` as features.

## Correlation notes (for C)

Strongest absolute Pearson correlations with `late` (excluding itself):
- `Days for shipment (scheduled)`: r = -0.3694
- `Order Item Total`: r = -0.0038
- `Benefit per order`: r = -0.0037
- `Sales`: r = -0.0036
- `Order Item Product Price`: r = -0.0022

Strongest absolute Pearson correlations with `loss` (excluding itself):
- `Benefit per order`: r = -0.6291
- `Days for shipment (scheduled)`: r = 0.0040
- `Order Item Discount Rate`: r = 0.0038
- `Longitude`: r = 0.0033
- `Order Item Total`: r = -0.0019

Remember: `Sales` and `Order Item Total` are highly collinear (kept both in Phase 1). Check VIF before OLS.

## Segments worth testing (for B)

These match the planned T1–T6 tests and are backed by the plots above.

1. Shipping Mode vs late — spread 38.07% to 95.32% (`Standard Class` vs `First Class`). Plot: `bar_late_rate_by_Shipping_Mode.png`.
2. Market vs late — spread 54.36% to 55.21% (`LATAM` vs `Europe`). Plot: `bar_late_rate_by_Market.png`.
3. Customer Segment vs loss — rates `Home Office` 18.85%, `Corporate` 18.82%, `Consumer` 18.60%. Plot: `bar_loss_rate_by_Customer_Segment.png`.
4. Profit across Markets (ANOVA / Kruskal–Wallis) — see `box_profit_by_Market.png` / `violin_profit_by_Market.png`.
5. Profit: late vs on-time (Welch t-test) — mean profit late 21.6217, on-time 22.4038.
6. Discount rate: loss vs profit (Welch t-test) — mean discount loss 0.1022, profit 0.1015. Plot: `overlay_discount_loss.png`.

## Limitations

EDA is descriptive only. With ~180k rows, tiny differences can look “significant” in later tests; prefer effect sizes. Leakage columns stay excluded. No modelling was done in Phase 2a.
